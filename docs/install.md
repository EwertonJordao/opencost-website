# Installation

## Before you begin
In order to deploy the Kubecost Helm Chart, ensure your Helm client is [3.0 or newer](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Via Helm
The easiest way to get started with OpenCost is to install with the [Kubecost helm chart](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/). This can be done with Helm 3 using the following commands:

```
helm repo add kubecost https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/
helm upgrade --install kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer --namespace kubecost --create-namespace
```

This install method provides access to all OpenCost and Kubecost Team functionality, can scale to large clusters, and is available for free.

## Alternative installation options

- You can run [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template/) against the [Kubecost helm chart](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/) to generate local YAML output. This requires extra effort when compared to directly installing the helm chart but is more flexible than deploying static YAML.

- Lastly, you can deploy OpenCost directly as a pod. Directions for this install path are available [here](https://github.com/kubecost/opencost/blob/master/deploying-as-a-pod.md). This install path just deploys the underlying OpenCost allocation model with a basic UI or is not meant to be enterprise-ready.

## Updating OpenCost with Helm
1. Update the Helm repo with command 'helm repo update'
2. Use 'helm upgradeâ€¦' with the same values as used during the installation.

You can downgrade or specify a version by adding '--version x.xx.x' to the Helm command in Step 2.

Any specific upgrade or compatibility issues between versions should be documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/releases).

## Deleting OpenCost
To uninstall Kubecost and its dependencies, run the following command:
'helm uninstall kubecost -n kubecost'
